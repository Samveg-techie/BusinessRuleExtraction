# Business Rules Extraction Benchmark Dataset
This repository contains a curated collection of programs and corresponding business rules that serves as a comprehensive resource for evaluating and advancing the Business Rules Extraction processes. The dataset encompasses a diverse range of programs, including both open-source and those generated using cutting-edge generative AI tools. We have also shared the Business Rules extracted by our tool corresponding to the programs.

## Folder Content
All the folders present in the root directory, are the COBOL program names each of which contains 3 files as follows:
* \<program-name\> : COBOL program
* \<program-name\>_GT.md : Contains the golden truth of the Business rules
* \<program-name\>_Rules.md : Contains the rules that we have extracted with the help of our tool.
